Library usage:

##### Visual Studio Solution (Windows) #####

 Build the static library "urg3d.lib" with urg3d_library-X.X.X/vs20**/urg3d.sln.
 (Visual studio 2019 project and visual studio 2022 project exist.)
 
 Sample solutions that use urg3d.lib exist in urg3d_library-X.X.X/vs20**/.
 Each sample can be tested on the above visual studio project if it is set as the startup project.

##### gcc (Linux, MinGW) #####

 Type "make" to compile the static library "liburg3d.a" and the shared library "liburg3d.so".
 If the compilation is successful, these libraries are created in urg3d_library-X.X.X/src/.

 (If you want to install the library to your system, execute "make install" as root.)

 Example programs exist in urg3d_library-X.X.X/samples.
